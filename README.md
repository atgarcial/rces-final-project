### Scientific Question

A warm (cool) tropical North Atlantic is associated with earlier (later) start dates of the rainy season in Central America, but the conditions in the tropical Pacific do not have the same impact. 

### Relevant Datasets

<p>Daily rainfall dataset<br>
[GPCP Version 3.1 Daily Precipitation Data Set (GPCPDAY)](https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/datasets/GPCPDAY_3.1/summary)</p>

<p>Sea surface temperature dataset<br>
[NOAA Smith and Reynolds Extended Reconstructed Sea Surface Temperature (ERSST) Level 4 Monthly Version 5](https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/dataset/REYNOLDS_NCDC_L4_MONTHLY_V5)</p>


### Summary  

Using a daily rainfall dataset, a start date (SD) of the rainy season will be computed using the criteria detailed in Alfaro (2002) base on 5-day accumulated precipitation and the exceeding of certain thresholds to measure the persistence of rainfall. Climatologies have to be calculated in order to have a reference date for a normal SD. The correlation between the SD and the sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans will be find, these ones computed from a global SST dataset, in order to find the influence of the SST on the onset of rainy season in Central America.
